# Chain-of-Thought Hijacking

This repository contains the reference implementation for **Chain-of-Thought Hijacking**, a jailbreak technique that exploits extended reasoning to weaken refusal behaviour in large reasoning models.

## 🚨 Purpose & Responsible Use

This code is released **for defensive research and model robustness evaluation only.**  
It is intended to help researchers and developers:

- Detect when long chain-of-thought reduces safety behaviour  
- Stress-test refusal stability across models  
- Develop mitigations for reasoning-driven jailbreaks  

**Do not use this method to cause harm.**  
We disclosed this vulnerability to multiple major AI labs in advance of publication.

## 🔧 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gentlyzhao/Hijacking.git
cd Hijacking
pip install -r requirements.txt
export GEMINI_API_KEY="..."      # Required (used for judge + attacker prompting)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."      # For GPT models
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="..."   # For Claude models
export GROK_API_KEY="..."        # For xAI models
```

## Basic Usage
Attack a single model
```
python main.py --target-model claude-4-sonnet
```
## Evaluate a slice of HarmBench
```
python main.py \
  --target-model gpt-o4-mini \
  --start-examples 1 \
  --end-examples 100
```

## Test a single custom goal
```
python main.py --goal "YOUR_GOAL_DESCRIPTION"
```
