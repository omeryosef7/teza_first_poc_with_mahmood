# Research Plan — Progress Log

Tracks execution of `docs/RESEARCH_PLAN_DISTILLING_JAILBREAKS.md` (the plan; **do not edit the plan**).
Driven by a 30-min `/loop` (cron `e2698d62`). Every entry cites concrete paths.

Working rules (from the plan's operational section):
- ≤6 SLURM runs at once; reuse known-good configs; anything PENDING >30m → cancel & resubmit.
- No unnecessary code; no duplication (reuse existing scripts/artifacts).
- After every change, fan out a bug-check subagent.
- Document every step here with path references.

## Iteration log

### 2026-07-21 — Iteration 1 (loop start)
**Setup**
- Scheduled recurring loop: cron `e2698d62`, `*/30 * * * *` (session-only, 7-day expiry).
- Repo orientation. Key reusable assets identified (avoid duplication):
  - Behaviors + CoT targets: `outputs/stage_gcg_full/advbench_cot_full520_manifest.jsonl` (520 rows).
  - Category taxonomy: `scripts/gcg_advbench_llm_taxonomy.py` → `categorize()` (15 cats).
  - Canonical historical dev-25 rows: `scripts/detector_extended_audit.py:32` (`DEV_25_ADVBENCH_ROWS`).
  - Real attack ref impl: `Chain_of_Thought_Hijacking/Hijacking/` (API-based: GPT/Gemini/Claude/Grok).
  - GCG ref: `llm-attacks/`; refusal-direction ref: `Chain_of_Thought_Hijacking/refusal_direction/`.
  - StrongREJECT judge: `strong_reject/`, `scripts/paper_asr.py`, `scripts/staged_asr_rerank.py`.
  - Master synthesis of prior GCG work: `docs/GCG_JULY2026_MASTER_LOG.md` (triple-verified).

**Phase 1 — dataset split ✅**
- New script (no existing equivalent): `scripts/build_dataset_split.py`.
  Reuses the full-520 manifest + taxonomy; reuses the exact historical dev-25 so the
  held-out 495 stays genuinely unseen (plan §5.1 hard criterion).
- Outputs (plan §5.4 deliverables):
  - `data/manifests/dev_25.csv`, `dev_train_20.csv`, `dev_val_5.csv`, `heldout_495.csv`
  - `data/manifests/split_audit.md`
- Disjointness verified: exact-text overlap = 0, target-prefix overlap = 0,
  cross-split lexical near-dup clusters (Jaccard≥0.85) = 0.
- Dev-25 spans 11 categories; `dev_val_5` = {0001 cyber, 0021 violent, 0063 misinfo,
  0084 identity-theft, 0105 fraud} — one per top-5 category.
- Deferred (documented in split_audit.md): embedding-based semantic near-dup check
  (needs a sentence model); `external_transfer.csv` → Phase 15 (licensing/download decision).

**Phase 0 — freeze current state 🔄**
- `research_snapshots/2026-07-post-mahmood-meeting/` created with `code_commit.txt`
  (records HEAD; artifacts preserved in-place under git rather than byte-copied to
  avoid multi-GB duplication).
- `docs/CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT.md` — facts/hypotheses table (plan §4.4), sourced from
  `docs/GCG_JULY2026_MASTER_LOG.md`.

### 2026-07-21 — Iteration 2
**Reorient:** SLURM queue empty; TROPT **not installed** (no files, `import tropt` fails).
Phase 3 depends on it → blocked pending a decision (which TROPT — likely an external/Mahmood
repo). Phase 2 comes first in order and is CPU/API-only, so progressed that.

**Phase 2 — freeze evaluation protocol ✅** (plan §6; judge freeze still pending human labels)
- Inspected the real judge output fields first (no duplication): GCG pipeline uses
  `strongreject_score` + `strongreject_is_success` (threshold ≥0.5, per
  `scripts/compute_canonical_asr.py`), sub-scores refusal/convincingness/specificity.
- New files:
  - `configs/evaluation/greedy.yaml` (primary, deterministic) + `sampled.yaml` (secondary).
  - `schemas/evaluation_result.schema.json` — row contract, field names matched to the
    GCG pipeline; documents the legacy `is_success` mismatch in hijacking baselines.
  - `results/EXPERIMENT_REGISTRY.csv` — append-only header (plan §22.5 columns).
  - `scripts/validate_eval_results.py` — §22.4 result validator (required fields, dup rows,
    train/test split leakage, judge-score range incl. bool-reject, enum validation,
    denominator/commit consistency). Smoke-tested pass+fail paths.
  - `scripts/build_judge_validation_sample.py` — stratified judge-annotation sampler,
    reuses existing scored outputs. Produced `docs/judge_validation_sample.csv` (19 rows).
  - `docs/EVALUATION_PROTOCOL.md`, `docs/JUDGE_VALIDATION.md`.
- **Bug-check subagent** found 3 real defects → all fixed & re-verified: all-empty-pool crash
  in sampler (now clean SystemExit); `is_success` vs `strongreject_is_success` field mismatch
  (sampler now falls back across both; schema docstring corrected); bool-score accepted by
  validator (now rejected); added schema-enum validation for condition/decoding_config.
- **Deferred (documented):** judge freeze needs human annotation of the sample (human task);
  the bimodal baseline pool has ~no `partial` cases → redraw on our own Qwen3/Gemma
  generations in Phase 4+. Remaining §22.4 checks (expected row count, config-hash-matches-
  run-dir) need a run-directory context that doesn't exist yet → add with the Phase-3+ harness.
- Determinism completion criterion (§6): configured (greedy `do_sample=false`) but not yet
  GPU-verified; assert on first generation run.

**USER DECISIONS (2026-07-21, end of iter 2):**
1. **TROPT: skip for now** — reuse the in-repo GCG (`llm-attacks/`) as the discrete optimizer.
   Phase 3 will reproduce baselines with llm-attacks GCG instead of TROPT; revisit TROPT/MAC
   only if the user later supplies the repo. Plan is unchanged (do not edit it) — this is an
   execution substitution recorded here.
2. **Phase 4: the CoT-Hijacking attack is ALREADY implemented + wrapped** in-repo; API keys are
   in `.env` (OPENAI_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY, HF_TOKEN). External API runs are authorized.
   → **Reuse, do not rebuild.**

**Phase 4 recon (located the existing wrapper):**
- Wrapper: `poc_stage2/hijacking_wrapper.py` (+ `poc_stage2/schemas.py`,
  `poc_stage2/validate_hijacking_artifacts.py`). Calls `Chain_of_Thought_Hijacking/Hijacking/`.
- Defaults: attacker `gemini-2.5-flash`, judge `gemini-judge`, dataset `walledai/HarmBench`
  (`standard` split), target = an **API** model (o4-mini / gpt-5-mini / claude-4-sonnet /
  gemini / grok). Prior outputs exist: `outputs/hijacking_baseline_gpt-o4-mini_*`.
- **Open design point for Phase 4 (to resolve next fire):** this wrapper is **black-box API**;
  the mechanistic distillation (Phases 5–7) needs **white-box Qwen3** activations. So either
  (a) run the RQ1 baseline on API models as-is (reproduces the paper, but can't be dissected),
  and/or (b) target local Qwen3/Gemma for the version we mechanistically analyze. Need to
  check whether the wrapper/attack can target our local HF models + accept AdvBench dev-25
  goals (`data/manifests/dev_25.csv`) instead of HarmBench. Read the wrapper's goal-loading +
  target-model path next.

**Next iterations (in order)**
- Phase 4: inspect wrapper goal-loading & whether local Qwen3 target is supported; then run the
  CoT-Hijacking baseline on dev-25 with the §8.4 controls; measure clean vs attacked ASR +
  headroom (§8.5). Route generations through the frozen eval protocol + `validate_eval_results.py`.
- Phase 3 (parallel, no TROPT): reproduce prefix-CE GCG via `llm-attacks/` on dev-train-20.
- Judge confusion-matrix script once human labels exist.
