# Follow-up Sprint Plan — Boombness / `d_surface` Mechanism / Clean Objective Gate

**Status:** plan recorded, not yet started.
**Written:** 2026-08-19
**Repository:** `first_poc/teza_first_poc_with_mahmood`
**Branch at time of writing:** `behavioral-causality-sprint`
**This file:** `external_md/BOOMBNESS_D_SURFACE_FOLLOWUP_PROGRESS.md`

You are continuing the Boombness / Doublespeak mechanistic-interpretability research project.

Use the current repository state from the previous Boombness sprint unless instructed otherwise. The previous sprint handover is the source of truth. **Do not trust old progress-log claims if they were later retracted.**

This file must contain the plan, progress updates, commands, artifacts, failures, corrections, current claims, and open questions. **Update it continuously.**

---

## 0. Important Context From the Previous Sprint

The previous sprint tried to extract a Boombness signal and turn it into a GCG/MAC objective.

The current conclusion is:

> **Do not build the GCG objective yet.**

The previous sprint found that `d_surface` is real and causal, but it does not behave like a useful attack objective. The clean G2 correlation failed, and the G4 objective gate failed.

### Previous ground truth to verify from artifacts before doing new work

1. **G1 survived:**
   - The decoded carrot→bomb meaning lives mainly in the demonstration block, not in the query codeword token.
   - Whole-answer G1 `demos_only L18` transplant is approximately **+68.9%** of span.
   - `query_only L18` transplant moves in the **wrong** direction.

2. **G3 survived:**
   - Attention to the whole demonstration block is causally involved.
   - Cutting all demo-block attention edges across all layers recovers approximately **75.2%** of the deletion ceiling.
   - Sparse top-k edge knockout did **not** work.
   - Codeword-scope knockout moves in the **wrong** direction.

3. **G2 was retracted:**
   - The original positive Boombness→ASR correlation was contaminated by pseudo-replication, designed-variance rows, and unsafe filtering.
   - Clean powered G2 was **null**.
   - The clean powered result for `d_surface|L12|proj` was approximately within-domain **rho = -0.066, p ≈ 0.49**.

4. **G4 failed:**
   - Additive Boombness steering did not license a GCG objective.
   - Both signs of steering suppressed ASR or worked through refusal.

5. **The strongest surviving behavioral result:**
   - Projecting out `d_surface` on external harmful prompts **increased** ASR.
   - This effect was strongest around **L6–L12**.
   - Matched random controls were mostly inert.
   - Removing refusalness increased ASR more strongly.
   - Removing **both** `d_surface` and refusalness increased ASR the most and showed interaction.

6. **Cross-model status:**
   - Qwen AdvBench causal replication was **floor-limited** and should not be cited as a causal failure or success.

### Required first write-up

Before implementing new science, write a section in this file called:

`## Previous Sprint Ground Truth`

For each claim above, record:

- source artifact path;
- model;
- dataset;
- n;
- query kind;
- layer/window;
- readout;
- result;
- current verdict;
- whether the claim is **established, retracted, superseded, or exploratory**.

**If any headline number does not reproduce from committed artifacts, stop and document the discrepancy before continuing.**

---

## 1. Core Scientific Goal

Do not start from "build a GCG objective."

The new scientific goal is:

> Understand what `d_surface` actually represents, why removing it increases ASR, how it interacts with refusalness, and whether a better token-level / prompt-level Boombness readout can produce a clean objective in the future.

**Main hypothesis to test:**
`d_surface` may not be "attack-enabling Boombness." It may instead be a mid-layer safety-relevant, harmful-surface, or semantic-salience channel. Removing it may make the model less able to represent the harmfulness of the request, thereby increasing compliance.

**Alternative hypotheses:**

1. `d_surface` is a real carrot/bomb surface direction, but it is not behaviorally aligned with ASR.
2. `d_surface` is still partially confounded with harmful context or safety salience.
3. `d_surface` is a general hazardous-object semantic axis.
4. `d_surface` is an artifact of the carrot/bomb bank but transfers because many harmful prompts share similar lexical/statistical structure.
5. `d_surface` interacts with refusalness: it does not cause refusal by itself, but it supplies semantic evidence that the refusal mechanism uses.

This sprint should distinguish between these hypotheses.

---

## 2. Non-Negotiable Engineering Rules

### 2.1 Documentation

Maintain this file: `external_md/BOOMBNESS_D_SURFACE_FOLLOWUP_PROGRESS.md`

For every stage, document:

- goal;
- exact command;
- SLURM job id;
- git commit;
- input artifacts;
- output artifacts;
- model;
- dataset;
- filters;
- sample size;
- failures;
- skipped rows;
- skip reasons;
- current interpretation;
- whether the result is exploratory or citable.

**Do not wait until the end. Update the md continuously.**

### 2.2 Reuse Existing Code

Do not write a lot of new code if existing code can do the job.

Reuse:

- existing Boombness bank infrastructure;
- existing 2×2 direction-fitting code;
- existing activation extraction code;
- existing intervention primitives;
- existing StrongReject judge pipeline;
- existing run metadata conventions;
- existing artifact analysis scripts;
- existing test utilities;
- existing code from the article / `external_repos/interp-jailbreak` when relevant.

Use the article code as much as possible for:

- token-position-localized analysis;
- surgical patching methodology;
- attention/path attribution;
- mechanism-score vs behavior correlation;
- strong-vs-weak comparison design;
- plotting and aggregation discipline.

**Do not copy blindly.** Adapt to our repo's model loader, tokenizer, bank schema, metadata, and safety constraints.

### 2.3 No Silent Failures

Every script must report:

- attempted rows;
- succeeded rows;
- failed rows;
- skipped rows;
- exact skip reasons;
- source artifacts;
- output artifacts;
- filters used.

- Never silently drop rows.
- Never silently mix query kinds.
- Never silently mix `bank_block`s.
- Never silently use self-fit directions unless explicitly labeled.
- Never report pooled statistics as causal or citable when within-domain / clustered inference is the correct estimand.

### 2.4 Self-Review

Always double-check yourself. Before making any claim, verify:

- sample size;
- prompt IDs;
- family IDs;
- `bank_block`;
- `family_slot`;
- query kind;
- readout position;
- layer;
- direction split;
- whether the direction is self-fit or cross-fit;
- whether the result is pooled, within-domain, clustered, or thresholded ASR;
- whether random controls are independent draws;
- whether controls ran successfully;
- whether the result survives known retractions.

Every 4 hours, do a code and output review and write it into this file under:

`## 4h Code and Output Review`

Include:

- what was checked;
- bugs found;
- artifacts inspected;
- claims downgraded or confirmed;
- next corrections.

### 2.5 Commits and Pushes

Commit after meaningful progress. Push after meaningful progress if remote access is available.

Commit messages should clearly say:

- what was implemented;
- what artifact/result it supports;
- whether it is **infrastructure, analysis, bugfix, or result**.

Do not commit huge raw harmful generations unless that is already the repo convention. Prefer artifact paths and aggregate metrics in the md.

### 2.6 Parallelism

Use subagents / parallel jobs where safe. Parallelize independent work:

- different layers;
- different datasets;
- different models;
- different readouts;
- independent controls;
- independent audits.

Do **not** parallelize anything that can create leakage, pseudo-replication, inconsistent seeds, duplicate controls, or unsafe joins.

Use fan-out subagents where helpful, but **every subagent output must be reviewed before being treated as fact.**

### 2.7 Loop Discipline

Run a progress loop every 30 minutes. Every loop should:

1. check running jobs;
2. inspect finished artifacts;
3. update this md;
4. commit if meaningful progress happened;
5. decide the next safe parallel jobs;
6. record open blockers.

Every 4 hours, do the deeper code/output review described above.

Use ultrathink / ultracode mode. **Be careful, not just fast.**

---

## 3. Phase A — Reproduce and Audit Previous Ground Truth

**Goal:** Confirm that the current repository state matches the previous sprint handover.

### Tasks

1. Locate canonical artifacts for:
   - G1 whole-answer transplant;
   - G3 whole-answer knockout;
   - G2 powered clean correlation;
   - G4 steering failure;
   - AdvBench external decomposition;
   - layer profile;
   - direction-specificity test;
   - comprehension controls;
   - Qwen replication attempt.
2. Recompute or inspect each headline number.
3. Create a "Do Not Cite" ledger in this file:

`## Retracted / Superseded Claims Not To Cite`

Include at least:

- original positive G2 correlation;
- original G1 +84% headline;
- original G3 84.35% / distributed-over-depth framing;
- sparse top-k attention-edge causal claim;
- any claim that Boombness is currently a usable GCG objective;
- any floor-limited Qwen AdvBench causal claim.

### Deliverables

- external md section with verified previous ground truth;
- artifact index;
- retraction ledger;
- one commit.

**Do not continue until this phase is complete.**

---

## 4. Phase B — Build Occurrence-Resolved Token-Level Boombness Readout

**Goal:** Separate token-level Boombness from prompt-level Boombness.

The previous sprint over-focused on one codeword/readout position. This phase must measure **every relevant occurrence.**

### Tasks

Implement or extend an extraction script that outputs one row per: prompt × occurrence × layer × metric.

**Occurrence roles:**

- first demo codeword;
- middle demo codewords;
- last demo codeword;
- all demo codewords aggregate;
- query codeword;
- readout position;
- nearby predicate/context tokens if feasible.

**For every row, store:**

`prompt_id`, `family_id`, `condition`, `bank_block`, `family_slot`, `split`, `domain`, `query_kind`, `n_examples`, `occurrence_index`, `occurrence_role`, `token_position`, `layer`, metric name, metric value, direction fit split, self-fit flag.

**Metrics:**

- `d_surface|L|proj`;
- `d_surface|L|cos`;
- `d_naive|L|proj`;
- `d_context|L|proj`;
- refusalness where available;
- logit lens concept-vs-codeword;
- whole-answer / forced-choice readout where valid.

### Required Audits

Add tests or checks for:

- correct tokenization of carrot/bomb;
- no confusion between `codeword_last` and `readout_pos`;
- no stripping `query_kind` from `family_id`;
- no semantic representation joined to behavioral ASR unless explicitly labeled;
- expected occurrence counts;
- exact `prompt_id` joins.

### Analyses

Produce layer-dynamics summaries for: first demo carrot; last demo carrot; average demo carrot; query carrot; readout position; predicate/context tokens if feasible.

**Key questions:**

1. Does Boombness increase from first demo occurrence to later demo occurrences?
2. Is the query carrot more or less bomb-like than demo carrots?
3. Does the signal appear in L6–L12, L14–L21, or late layers?
4. Does `d_surface` differ from `d_naive` and `d_context`?
5. Is refusalness independent at these positions?

### Deliverables

- `outputs/boombness_followup/token_level_occurrence_readouts.jsonl`
- `outputs/boombness_followup/token_level_dynamics_summary.json`
- plots/tables if useful;
- external md interpretation.

---

## 5. Phase C — Refit and Validate a Better Boombness Probe

**Goal:** Build a probe only if it avoids the "stupid probe" problem. The probe must not merely learn lexical identity or prompt artifacts.

### Tasks

Refit probe variants on the current bank:

1. simple lexical probe;
2. aligned 2×2 probe;
3. hard-negative probe;
4. heldout-domain probe;
5. surface-matched codeword probe;
6. concept-surface probe;
7. optional hazardous-object generalization probe.

Use strict train/test separation:

- group by family;
- group by domain where relevant;
- no overlapping slots across train/test;
- no self-fit leakage;
- shuffled-label control;
- random-direction control.

Evaluate probe coverage over the full current bank. **Do not use the probe as a headline metric unless coverage is high enough and controls pass.**

### Required Outputs

For each probe: train n; test n; domains; family slots; AUROC / accuracy / margin distribution; shuffled-label result; domain-heldout result; correlation with `d_surface`; correlation with refusalness; whether it generalizes outside carrot/bomb.

### Deliverables

- `outputs/boombness_followup/probe_validation.json`
- probe artifacts;
- external md section: `## Probe Validation and Leakage Checks`

---

## 6. Phase D — Clean Designed-Variance Bank for Fig-9-Style Test

**Goal:** Re-test whether prompt-level Boombness can predict ASR, but with a clean design.

The previous G2 failed because contaminated rows and pseudo-replication produced a false positive. **Do not repeat that.**

### Design Requirements

Build or generate a new balanced designed-variance bank where the following factors can vary independently:

1. number of demonstrations;
2. strength/aggressiveness of demonstrations;
3. consistency of mapping;
4. position of relevant demonstrations;
5. role/style framing if useful.

**Hard constraints:**

- no overlapping family slots across independent rows;
- no slot 1/2 pseudo-replication unless explicitly grouped and not treated as independent;
- balanced prompt length as much as possible;
- balanced number of target occurrences;
- balanced `n_examples` when testing strength/position/consistency;
- at least **120 behavioral rows per level** where possible;
- use domain clusters;
- keep query kind fixed for behavior;
- representation and ASR must be from the same `prompt_id` unless explicitly labeled otherwise.

### Analyses

For each candidate prompt-level metric:

- average demo-token Boombness;
- query-token Boombness;
- readout-position Boombness;
- max over demo tokens;
- AUC over layers;
- L6–L12 average;
- L14–L21 average;
- probe margin;
- refusalness;
- Boombness minus refusalness.

Compute: pooled rho; within-domain rho; domain-clustered regression; permutation p; family-wise correction over metric/layer choices; nested layer/metric selection; incremental R² over refusalness; negative controls.

### Decision Gate D

Only if a prompt-level metric predicts ASR cleanly under within-domain / clustered inference **and** survives multiplicity correction should we consider a future GCG objective.

If this fails again, explicitly write:

> `Prompt-level Boombness is not currently a usable optimization target.`

### Deliverables

- new bank or bank-extension artifacts;
- ASR generations and judge artifacts;
- `outputs/boombness_followup/clean_fig9_correlation.json`
- external md section: `## Clean Fig-9-Style Boombness vs ASR Test`

---

## 7. Phase E — Decompose What `d_surface` Really Represents

**Goal:** Understand why projecting out `d_surface` increases ASR on external harmful prompts.

### E1. External semantic categories

Run `project_out d_surface` on multiple external categories:

- weapons/explosives;
- cyber;
- fraud;
- drugs;
- self-harm if allowed by existing benchmark safety handling;
- benign technical prompts;
- benign everyday prompts;
- ambiguous dual-use prompts.

For each category, compare: baseline; remove `d_surface`; remove refusalness; remove both; matched random control; `d_context`; `d_naive`.

### E2. Layer profile replication

Replicate the layer profile with more layers: L4, L6, L8, L10, L12, L13, L14, L16, L18, L20, L24.

If compute is limited, prioritize **L6–L16**.

### E3. Direction specificity

Compare: `d_surface`; `d_naive`; `d_context`; `d_inter`; random matched directions; refusalness; orthogonalized `d_surface` against refusalness; orthogonalized refusalness against `d_surface`.

### E4. Semantic-salience interpretation

For prompts where removing `d_surface` increases ASR, inspect **safe summaries / labels only**:

- does the model become less likely to identify danger?
- does refusal decrease?
- does harmful compliance increase?
- does comprehension change?
- does output become more generic or more specific?

**Do not print harmful instructions. Use redacted summaries and aggregate statistics.**

### Deliverables

- `outputs/boombness_followup/d_surface_external_decomposition.json`
- `outputs/boombness_followup/d_surface_layer_profile_replication.json`
- `outputs/boombness_followup/direction_specificity_extended.json`
- external md interpretation: `## What Does d_surface Represent?`

---

## 8. Phase F — Interaction With Refusalness

**Goal:** Understand whether `d_surface` and refusalness are independent, additive, synergistic, or sequential.

### Experiments

Run composed interventions:

1. baseline;
2. remove `d_surface`;
3. remove refusalness;
4. remove both;
5. remove `d_surface`, then add refusalness;
6. remove refusalness, then add `d_surface`;
7. add `d_surface`;
8. add refusalness;
9. add both;
10. matched random controls.

Run across the active layer band: L6, L8, L10, L12, optional L14/L16.

**Metrics:** continuous StrongReject score; ASR@0.5; refusal rate; comprehension / semantic control where available; generation degeneracy/coherence; interaction term with clustered bootstrap.

**Key questions:**

- Does `d_surface` supply evidence used by refusalness?
- Does removing `d_surface` increase ASR only when refusalness is intact?
- Does refusalness dominate all behavior?
- Does removing both exceed the sum of each alone?
- Is the interaction layer-localized?

### Deliverables

- `outputs/boombness_followup/refusal_interaction.json`
- external md section: `## d_surface × Refusalness Interaction`

---

## 9. Phase G — Better Surgical Patching

**Goal:** The previous sprint showed that sparse top-k attention edges are not sufficient. Try more meaningful surgical interventions.

**Do not repeat the top-16 edge search as if it is likely to work.**

### Candidate Surgical Units

1. whole demo block;
2. first demonstration only;
3. last demonstration only;
4. predicate/context tokens around codewords;
5. all codeword tokens in demos;
6. query codeword;
7. readout position;
8. MLP write/carry windows;
9. residual stream direction projection;
10. path patching from demo block to mid-layer residual / MLP to readout.

Use article-code best practices for patching and path attribution.

### Required Controls

For every intervention: random position control; random direction control; matched edge-count control if using attention; comprehension control; option-mass / readout validity check; generation coherence check for behavioral runs.

### Deliverables

- `outputs/boombness_followup/surgical_units.json`
- external md section: `## Better Surgical Patching Results`

---

## 10. Phase H — Cross-Model Replication Without Floor Effects

**Goal:** Replicate only where the model/dataset has enough behavioral dynamic range.

**Do not use a floor-limited setup to claim mechanism failure.**

### Tasks

For each candidate model:

1. measure baseline ASR on candidate datasets;
2. select datasets where baseline is not near zero and not saturated;
3. fit or import model-specific refusal direction;
4. fit model-specific `d_surface` if tokenization/alignment is valid;
5. run a small layer profile around relative mid-layer depth;
6. run external decomposition if dynamic range exists.

**Candidate models:**

- Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct as primary;
- Qwen3-14B only on a dataset with non-floor ASR;
- Phi or another model only after tokenization audit and smoke tests pass.

### Deliverables

- `outputs/boombness_followup/cross_model_dynamic_range.json`
- `outputs/boombness_followup/cross_model_decomposition.json`
- external md section: `## Cross-Model Replication With Dynamic Range`

---

## 11. Phase I — GCG/MAC Objective Gate

**Do not implement GCG unless the gate passes.**

### Gate Requirements

A Boombness-based objective can only be attempted if:

1. a clean prompt-level metric predicts ASR under within-domain / clustered inference;
2. the result survives multiplicity correction;
3. the metric is not just refusalness;
4. random controls fail;
5. comprehension is preserved;
6. the effect replicates on heldout domains or external prompts;
7. direction/additive intervention has the expected sign.

If any of these fail, **do not implement GCG.** Instead, write a clear negative result.

### If Gate Passes

Only if the gate passes, implement a minimal GCG/MAC objective using existing code.

**Candidate objectives:**

1. maximize clean prompt-level Boombness metric;
2. maximize Boombness minus refusalness;
3. maximize demo-block aggregate Boombness;
4. maximize L6–L12 Boombness signal;
5. maximize probe margin only if probe validation passed.

**Compare against:** standard GCG; refusal-only objective; random suffix; fluency-only control; Boombness-only; Boombness-minus-refusalness.

**Metrics:** train ASR; heldout ASR; transfer; achieved Boombness; refusalness; comprehension; malformed output rate; suffix length; generation quality.

**But again: do not start this unless the gate passes.**

---

## 12. Final Report Requirements

At the end of the sprint, write a final section in this file:

`## Sprint Final Report`

It must answer:

1. What did we verify from the previous sprint?
2. What is `d_surface` most likely measuring?
3. Is `d_surface` separable from refusalness?
4. Why does removing `d_surface` increase ASR?
5. Does token-level Boombness behave differently from prompt-level Boombness?
6. Is there a clean Fig-9-style Boombness→ASR correlation?
7. Are any surgical interventions actually useful?
8. Does the result replicate across datasets / models?
9. Is a GCG objective justified?
10. What are the strongest new findings?
11. What was retracted or downgraded during this sprint?
12. What should the next sprint do?

Each claim must point to an artifact.
**No unsupported claims. No stale numbers. No harmful completions.**

---

## 13. Execution Instruction

Implement this plan. Document progress in this external markdown file so we can track progress.

- Follow the instructions in the plan.
- Do not write a lot of code if you do not need to. Reuse the existing code and the article code as much as possible.
- Do not skip any stage from the plan unless you have to. If a stage should be skipped, document why and consult the user.
- Use subagents to run things in parallel. Anything that can be parallelized without hurting the results should be parallelized.
- Our goal is to add to this paper and find new things with this research.
- Always double-check for bugs.
- Do a code review before trusting results.
- Commit and push after meaningful progress so the work is trackable.
- Use ultrathink, ultracode, fan out subagents, and run a progress loop every 30 minutes.
- Every 4 hours, do a code and output review and document it here.

# Progress Log

**Sprint started:** 2026-08-19. **Branch:** `behavioral-causality-sprint`.
**Current phase:** A (reproduce and audit previous ground truth) — IN PROGRESS.
**Gate status:** Phase A is a hard gate. No Phase B+ science until the section-0 claims reproduce.

---

## Session Log

### 2026-08-19 — Entry 1: orientation and inherited state

**Goal.** Locate the previous sprint's handover and canonical artifacts; establish what is committed,
what is dirty, and what is still running, before any claim is verified.

**Source of truth located.** `reports/BOOMBNESS_SPRINT_HANDOVER_2026-08-16_TO_08-19.md` (6,623 lines,
covers 2026-08-16 18:04 → 2026-08-19 10:30, reference HEAD `8a7421dd`). This document supersedes the
older `doublespeak_causality/*.md` logs for anything Boombness-related. It carries its own
Appendix A (retracted figures), Appendix B (two retraction ledgers), Appendix C (artifact index) and
Appendix D (reproduction commands). Treated as a **map to artifacts, not as evidence** — every number
below is verified against committed JSON, per plan §2.3.

Supporting documents, in currency order:
- `docs/BOOMBNESS_CONTINUATION_LOG.md` (3,004 lines) — ledger 2 (`R-6` … `R-19`).
- `docs/BOOMBNESS_SPRINT_PROGRESS.md` — ledger 1 (`RETRACTION #1` … `#9`), append-only journal.
- `reports/boombness_objective_sprint_report.md` (2,095 lines) — the formal report; the handover
  flags three places where it still carries retracted figures unqualified (see below).
- `docs/BOOMBNESS_SPRINT_EXTERNAL_CRITIQUE_2026-08-18.md` — the external critique and its defect table.

**Artifacts.** 50 top-level analysis JSONs under `outputs/boombness/` (the handover's census said 48;
two landed after it was written: `advbench_direction_specificity.json` and `concept_pair_screen.json`).
All 17 headline-bearing artifacts confirmed **git-tracked**:

`g1_wholeanswer_sow` · `g1_stratified` · `g3_wholeanswer_block24` · `g3_wholeanswer_codeword24` ·
`g2_analysis_POWER` · `g2_analysis_cwpos_CLEAN` · `g2_analysis_cwpos` · `steering_analysis` ·
`steering_band_real` · `advbench_decomposition` · `advbench_layer_profile` ·
`advbench_superadd_control` · `advbench_decomposition_qwen3` · `clearharm_decomposition_regoal` ·
`clearharm_decomposition_qwen3` · `direction_cosines` · `section4b_whole_answer`

## Inherited State — Integrity Findings

### ⚠ IF-1: a tracked artifact is dirty in the working tree, and the dirt is a retracted figure

`outputs/boombness/clearharm_decomposition.json` is **modified and uncommitted**. The diff
(67 insertions, 3 deletions) adds two control-band judge runs and **rewrites the `control_band` block**:

| | committed (`70709348`) | working tree |
|---|---|---|
| `control_band.n_draws` | `1` | `3` |
| `control_band.note` | *"fewer than 3 independent control draws; between-draw variance is unestimated…"* | *(removed)* |
| `control_band.between_draw_sd` | *(absent)* | `0.0048381307473991` |

`0.0048` is **exactly the figure R-12 retracted** as a fake band. Worse, the working-tree draws are not
independent: `ctrlband_s20260901` and `ctrlband_s20260902` both record
`paired_delta_mean = 0.018156424581005588` — byte-identical, the R-12 signature (`score_behavior.py:123`
recursing into composed arms without passing `control_seed`). Only `s20260903` differs (`0.009777`).
So the working tree claims `n_draws: 3` where the effective n is **2**.

**Direction of the change matters:** the committed version is the *corrected* one (`n_draws: 1` with an
honest note); the working tree has *reverted* to the retracted band. This is an un-reviewed regeneration
sitting on top of a correction.

**Disposition:** do **not** commit this hunk. The file is superseded anyway (pre-R-14 empty-goal
judging — see the Do-Not-Cite ledger); its replacement is `clearharm_decomposition_regoal.json`.
Recommended action is `git checkout -- outputs/boombness/clearharm_decomposition.json`.
**Not yet executed — flagged for the user, since discarding working-tree state is destructive.**

### IF-2: six SLURM jobs inherited from the previous sprint are still queued

All `PD (Priority)` on the `killable` partition, all invoking
`src/boombness/slurm/run_boombness.sh`. Identified from `outputs/boombness/argsfiles/`:

| jobid | submitted | argsfile | what it is | which phase it feeds |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 767176, 767177 | 08-19 10:03 | `args_abL13_Bctrl` / `args_abL14_Bctrl` | matched random controls for the L13/L14 edge probe — the handover lists L13/L14 as **arm-only** without them | Phase A verification of "controls inert"; Phase E2 |
| 767263–767266 | 08-19 11:33 | `args_abR{8,12,24,28}_C` | **refusalness** (arm C) at L8 / L12 / L24 / L28 on AdvBench 495 | Phase E2 + **Phase F** (refusalness layer profile) |

All six target `data/boombness_prompts/external/advbench_heldout_495.jsonl` against the canonical fit dir
`extract_boombness/full_20260816_185942_1008673`, `--query-kinds behavioral --max-new 512`.

**Decision: let them run; harvest, do not resubmit.** 767263–767266 are a refusalness layer profile that
Phase F would otherwise have to launch itself — inherited work that is directly on-plan.

### IF-3: three retracted figures still stand unqualified in `reports/boombness_objective_sprint_report.md`

Carried forward from the handover's §13.15 and Appendix A.2, to be re-checked in Phase A:
report §13 criterion 1 (`ρ=+0.307`, dead by R-18); §13 criteria 3/4 (`p=0.681`, dead by R-6);
§8b/N5 (G1 query transplant at `−71%`, superseded by `−57.0%`). The `retraction_sweep.py` guard reports
clean because markdown tables are one paragraph and a marker word in any row exempts every row.

## Phase B Feasibility — resolved early, and it is good news

Plan §4 (Phase B) asks for an occurrence-resolved token-level readout. **The extraction already emits
exactly this**, so Phase B is an *analysis* task over an existing artifact, not a new extraction run.
This is the plan §2.2 "do not write new code if existing code can do the job" case.

`src/boombness/extract_boombness.py` (941 LOC) writes one row per (prompt × occurrence) with these
metadata columns already present in `extract_boombness/full_20260816_185942_1008673/results.jsonl`:

```
prompt_id  family_id  condition  cell  domain  split  bank_block  query_kind  n_examples
strength  consistency  example_position  role_style  target_surface
occurrence_index  n_occurrences  is_final_occurrence  is_query_occurrence
token_pos  seq_len  n_subtokens  is_single_token
directions_fitted_on  is_self_fit  layer_convention
```

plus **333 metric columns**, including `d_surface|L{0..31}|proj`, `d_surface|L|cos`, `d_naive|L|proj`,
`d_context|L|proj`, `d_inter|L|proj`, `hnorm|L`, and logit-lens `ll|L|boombness` / `p_concept` /
`p_codeword` / `rank_concept` (plus `llfollow|L|*` at the following token).

Census of that file (117 MB, 8,472 rows):

| field | distribution |
|---|---|
| rows | 8,472 |
| occurrence role | demo 7,008 · query 1,464 |
| `bank_block` | core2x2 5,328 · families 816 · extra_conditions 792 · role_style 600 · strength 432 · consistency 384 · position 120 |
| `query_kind` | behavioral 3,756 · semantic_one_word 2,940 · comprehension_usage 1,776 |
| `n_occurrences` | 1:192 · 2:408 · 3:576 · 4:48 · 5:1,860 · 6:432 · 8:96 · 9:2,052 · 10:360 · 17:2,448 |
| `is_self_fit` | False for all 8,472 rows (cross-fit throughout) |

**Gaps Phase B must still close** (recorded now so they are not discovered late):
1. `family_slot` is **not** a top-level column — it is encoded inside `family_id`
   (`farm_storage\|dev\|slot0\|n0\|none\|consistent\|near\|plain\|behavioral`). Phase B must parse
   it out explicitly, because plan §4 requires it as a stored field and R-18 was caused by a missing
   slot filter.
2. `occurrence_role` (first-demo / middle-demo / last-demo / query) must be **derived** from
   `occurrence_index` + `is_query_occurrence` + `n_occurrences`. Not stored.
3. Refusalness is in a separate producer (`refusalness/cwpos_…`, `refusalness/lastpos_…`) and must be
   joined on `prompt_id`.
4. This extract is over the **1,464-row** bank. The bank was later regenerated to **2,352** rows
   (`extract_boombness/full2352_20260818_115332_1410155`). The handout's R-10/C-13 defect was exactly a
   population mismatch between a 1,464-row cache and a 2,352-row bank. Phase B must pick one and say so.

Reusable elsewhere: `probes.py` (963 LOC) for Phase C, `analyze_external_arms.py` (407 LOC) for
Phases E/F, `surgical_knockout.py` + `aggressive_patching.py` for Phase G, `coherence_gate.py` for every
behavioural arm, `score_behavior.py` + `judge_boombness.py` for generation and judging.

## Previous Sprint Ground Truth

_In progress — a 7-agent verification fan-out is recomputing each headline number from committed JSON,
each followed by an adversarial refutation pass. Table lands when it returns._

## Retracted / Superseded Claims Not To Cite

_In progress — will be assembled from the handover's Appendix A (23 labelled retraction entries across
two ledgers, 22 distinct events) after each entry's evidencing artifact is confirmed to exist._

## Open Questions / Blockers

- **IF-1 needs a user decision:** discard the working-tree modification to
  `clearharm_decomposition.json` (which re-introduces the R-12 retracted band), or keep it? Recommended:
  discard. Not executed unilaterally because it destroys working-tree state.
- Phase A gate is not yet passed; no Phase B+ execution has begun.
