## 2026-08-11 — PHASE 0 START

### E0.1 Environment / baseline state
- Branch `behavioral-causality-sprint`, clean tree at `f0ef1ccc`.
- SLURM: 0 jobs owned by user. `killable` partition has idle L40S-class nodes
  (`n-[203-205,305,501-502]` idle, 13 mix). Budget rule: **≤6 concurrent GPU jobs**.
- Conda envs: `base`, `poc_stage2`. `poc_stage2` is the torch/transformers env.
- Offline HF cache at `$ROOT/.cache/huggingface`.

### E0.2 Data inventory (verified directly)
`data/gcg/clearharm_llama_v3/clearharm_llama_doublespeak.jsonl`: **n=148**, splits
`train=74 / dev=37 / test=37`. Fields include `task_id` (unique id), `split`,
`intent_cluster` (cluster field), `instruction`, `safe_target_prefix`, `codeword`,
`neutral_control_suffix`, `harm_category`.
`..._trainpool40.jsonl`: **n=40**, all `split=train` (the frozen optimization pool).

**Note for train/test discipline:** there is an untouched **`dev` split (n=37)**. It is
cluster-disjoint from test by construction of v3. This sprint uses `dev` for any
hyperparameter / threshold / layer selection that the 40-item train pool cannot support,
so that **test (n=37) is never used for selection**.

`data/pair_benchmark/`: all five pairs present — `pair_carrot_{bomb,grenade,pistol,chlorine,cocaine}.json`.

## GATE A — REPRODUCTION INTEGRITY / CODE AUDIT

### E0.3 Position-convention audit of the refusal direction across the three code paths

The plan (§19.3) requires asserting the refusal *vector* is the same object across code
paths. Auditing the code paths surfaced a more serious issue: the vector is (probably) the
same, but the **position at which it is read differs across all three paths**, and one of
those positions is computed incorrectly.

The three code paths and the residual-stream position each uses:

| Path | File | Position read | Layer index |
|---|---|---|---|
| **(i) Direction fit** | `build_refusal_direction_llama.py:83` `hs[L+1][0,-1,:]` | **last token of the templated prompt** (i.e. after `<\|start_header_id\|>assistant<\|end_header_id\|>\n\n`) — the decision position | `hs[L+1]` |
| **(ii) Activation ablation (the causal result)** | `pair_common.py:637` `make_project_out_hook` | **EVERY position, EVERY decode step**, and (multilayer variant) every layer | block output = `hs[L+1]` |
| **(iii) GCG token objective** | `gcg_optimizer.py:687` `refusal_dir_positions = [init_spans_rd.suffix_slice.stop - 1]` | **one fixed absolute token index**, derived from `train_tasks[0]` only | `hs[layer_idx]` passed as `k+1` (off-by-one handled) |
| **(iv) Mech-validity readout (Q5)** | `scripts/phase_gate7_mech_validity.py:89` `hs[row][0,-1,:]` | last token of the templated prompt — matches (i) | `hs[k+1]` |

**DEFECT D1 — cross-task absolute-position misalignment in the GCG objective. CONFIRMED.**
`refusal_dir_positions` is computed ONCE from `train_tasks[0]` (`gcg_optimizer.py:680-687`)
and then passed unchanged as an **absolute token index** into `_token_gradients`
(`gcg_optimizer.py:812`) and into candidate selection (`:433,:440`) for *every* task.
Prompt lengths differ across the 40-item train pool, so the index is only correct for task 0.
`_token_gradients` silently drops out-of-range positions
(`gcg_optimizer.py:172` `if pos < lt.shape[1]`), and `refusal_direction_loss` returns
`0.0` when no position survives (`objectives.py:224`) — i.e. the mechanism term silently
contributes nothing for those tasks.

Measured on the actual frozen train pool (Llama-3.1-8B tokenizer, `suffix_placement=user`,
suffix_len=16, init `' !'×16`):

```
suffix_slice.stop across the 40 train prompts: min 161, max 276, mean 241.6, std 17.5
fixed position used for ALL tasks (from task 0): P = 233

P inside the task's own suffix span :  17 / 40
P before the suffix (in instruction):  12 / 40
P after the suffix (header/target)  :  10 / 40
P out of range -> term silently 0    :   1 / 40
|P - task's own last-suffix-token|  : mean 14.0, median 9.5, max 73
EXACT matches (P == own last suffix token) : 1 / 40   (task 0 itself)
```

So the refusal/concept representation objective was evaluated at the intended position for
**1 of 40** training prompts.

**DEFECT D2 — fit-position vs use-position mismatch. CONFIRMED.**
Even for task 0, the intended position (`suffix_slice.stop - 1`, the last *suffix* token,
which lives inside the **user** turn) is not the position the direction was fitted and
causally validated at (the last token of the templated prompt, after the assistant header).
Verified token layout for train-pool item 0:

```
suffix_slice = [218, 234)   target_slice = [239, 260)
tokens between suffix end and target: ['<|eot_id|>', '<|start_header_id|>', 'assistant',
                                       '<|end_header_id|>', '\n\n']
```

The decision position is index **238**; the GCG objective reads index **233** — five tokens
earlier, still inside the user turn.

**DEFECT D3 — intervention-scope asymmetry (not a bug, but must be stated).**
The activation-space causal result ablates the direction at **all positions, all decode
steps, and (multilayer) all layers**. The token-space objective touches **one position at
one layer**. Any comparison of "activation-space causality" vs "token-space optimizability"
is therefore also a comparison of intervention *scope*, not only of intervention *medium*.
This must be controlled for in Phase 2's control-hierarchy figure (Figure A), and is a
first-class alternative explanation alongside H1–H5.

**Scientific consequence (stated carefully, per plan §3.15).**
D1/D2 affect the *refusal* arm and its *norm-matched random* arm **identically** — both used
the same misaligned position. Therefore:
- the **comparison** "refusal ≈ random" is still an apples-to-apples comparison, and the
  reported ASR numbers stand as reported;
- but the **interpretation** "we optimized the validated refusal projection in token space
  and it did not help" is **NOT supported**, because for 39/40 training prompts the objective
  was not reading the validated refusal coordinate at all.

Gate D's negative is therefore downgraded from "the refusal objective fails" to
**"an objective that mostly did not measure the refusal coordinate fails"** — which is a much
weaker statement and re-opens H3 (objective/optimizer failure). This is recorded as a
**SUPERSEDED-PENDING** status for the Gate-D interpretation, not a withdrawal of the numbers.

**Actions taken:** see gap matrix rows R1–R3 in `docs/ASYMMETRY_GAP_MATRIX.md`. A
per-task position fix is required before any Phase 3 work, and a corrected-objective arm
becomes a *scientifically justified* Phase 3 candidate (it tests a hypothesis the old run
could not test).

## 2026-08-11 — PHASE 0 COMPLETE

### E0.4 Twelve-agent code/artifact audit (6 topics x audit+adversarial-verify)
Topics: direction fitting · GCG optimizer · mech-validity + activation intervention · data/splits ·
SLURM/TROPT infrastructure · handoff-number traceability. Every audit report was independently
re-checked by a second agent. Headline results:

- **A1 traceability: 0 numeric mismatches.** All 20 GCG arm ASRs, `GATE7_V3_MATRIX_STATS.json`,
  `GATE7_V3_MECH_VALIDITY_seed42.json` and the 3 quantization summaries reproduce the handoff exactly.
- **A2 / plan §19.3 direction identity: PASS.** `outputs/stage_gcg_full/refusal_direction_llama_L{12,14,16,18,20}.pt`
  are **md5-identical** to `outputs/refusal_alllayers/refusal_direction_llama_L{same}.pt` (cosine 1.0).
  No silent cross-code-path vector mismatch. The concept vector used by GCG
  (`concept_neg_L9_unit.pt`) is confirmed cos=1.000000 with `unified_directions/clearharm.npz["concept"][9]`
  (fit layer 9 → `hs[10]`), and only 0.56 with the `curated` cohort — so the clearharm cohort is the source.
- **A6 NEW LIMITATION.** The L18 refusal axis was fit on `pair_benchmark/pair_carrot_bomb.json` with
  **n_harmful=60 / n_harmless=20** (harmless = 20 hardcoded generic instructions, not the matched
  `neutral` prompts), then applied to ClearHarm-v3 doublespeak prompts. Cross-distribution transfer;
  never previously flagged. Belongs in the paper's limitations.
- **A7 NEW CONTEXT FOR Q2.** `refusal_direction_llama_SELECTED.json` records per-layer ablate+induce
  validation: L14 0.40, L16 0.80, **L18 1.133 (selected)**, L20 0.60, and **L12 = −0.333, `valid=false`**.
  L12 is the ONLY layer that failed validation — and Q2's "Jacobian-peak" arm targeted L12. Its negative
  is therefore weak evidence about token-space reachability.
- Infrastructure: conda env `poc_stage2` (py3.12 / torch 2.7.1 / transformers 5.12.1) is the project env;
  **TROPT is importable only from `$ROOT/TROPT/.venv/bin/python`** (py3.13 / torch 2.11 / transformers 5.8.1)
  and that venv has **no StrongREJECT checkout**, so any behavioral reranking under TROPT needs a
  two-process split. MAC (`MAC__wang2024`) and SoftPrompt (`SoftPrompt__schwinn2024`) recipes exist, and
  `$ROOT/scripts/phase3_tropt_optimize.py` is an existing MAC driver.
- Reusable prior art found for Phase 2: `$DC/37_soft_prompt_objective.py` implements the **simplex
  (softmax-over-vocabulary) relaxation** whose optimum upper-bounds any token sequence, plus
  discretization-retention and peak-weight diagnostics — exactly the instrument plan §19.4 asks for.
  `phase6_jacobian_readout.py` does **not** help Phase 1: it creates an `inputs_embeds` leaf only to avoid
  a param-grad buffer and **never reads `embeds.grad`**, so no input-embedding Jacobian exists in the repo.

### E0.5 Deliverables written
- `docs/ASYMMETRY_GAP_MATRIX.md` — full classification + §E pre-registration (target position, rows,
  selection split, controls, subspace-honesty rule, Figure A quantities, D3 scope-matched arm).
- Instruments: `scripts/asym_p1_reachability.py`, `scripts/asym_p1_analyze.py`,
  `scripts/asym_p1c_mech_validity_ext.py`, `scripts/asym_p2_softprompt.py`;
  runners `slurm/run_asym_p1_reach.sh`, `slurm/run_asym_p2_soft.sh`.

### GATE A VERDICT: **CONDITIONAL PASS** — GPU work authorised.
Numbers reproduce (A1) and the direction is one object (A2), so nothing is withdrawn. The position
defects D1/D2 change the *interpretation* of the token-space arm, and A6/A7 are limitations to carry.

### E0.6 Smoke tests submitted
- job **750338** `asym_p1_reachability.py --smoke` (2 prompts, 4 random dirs, 3 sub-tokens), split=train.
- jobs **750350 / 750351** `asym_p2_softprompt.py --smoke`, param=free (budget_rel 1.0) and param=simplex.
Per plan §3.1 no scale run is submitted until a smoke run loads the model, locates the suffix span,
computes the objective, takes an optimizer step and writes the intended scalars.

## 2026-08-11 — GATE A ADDENDUM

### E0.7 The program reports TWO different binary "ASR"s under one name — quantified, benign
Found while scoping Phase 4. The two halves of the handoff use different StrongREJECT
binary thresholds:

| Pipeline | Threshold | Source |
|---|---|---|
| GCG held-out eval (Q1–Q4 table) | **≥ 0.5** | `26_eval_p9_gcg_heldout_asr.py:163` counts `strongreject_is_success` |
| Every behavioural harness (Q6 Phi X1/X3, Q7 quantization) | **0.25** | `MAL_THRESHOLD = 0.25` — `scripts/phase_behav_refusal.py:58`, `phase_behav_carry.py:52`, `14_behavioral_eval.py:33`, `scripts/behav_judge.py:85` |

`docs/RESEARCH_HANDOFF.md` §2.3/§3.6 and the sprint plan §3.6 both state 0.5. So the
behavioural ASRs were produced at 0.25 while being described as 0.5.

**Cost to fix: zero GPU.** `raw.jsonl` stores the continuous per-item `{arm}_score`, so the
binary label is recomputable on CPU. New tool: `scripts/asym_relabel_asr.py`
→ `reports/ASYM_ASR_THRESHOLD_AUDIT.json`.

**Result — the discrepancy is real but changes nothing.** Over all three quantization runs
(test n=42 each), **27 paired contrasts**: **0 sign flips, 0 significance flips, max shift in
ΔASR = 0.0714.** The Q7 headline numbers at both thresholds:

| Precision | handoff ΔASR α=1 | recomputed @0.25 | recomputed @0.5 | McNemar p @0.5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| bf16 | +0.286 | **+0.2857** | **+0.2857** | 0.000488 |
| 8-bit | +0.262 | **+0.2619** | **+0.2619** | 0.007385 |
| 4-bit | +0.571 | **+0.5714** | **+0.5476** | ~0 |

The random-ablation control stays flat at both thresholds (|Δ| ≤ 0.0476, all p ≥ 0.5) in
every precision. **Q7's dose-dependent, specific, quantization-robust conclusion is
threshold-robust.** This also independently re-reproduces the handoff's Q7 numbers from raw
per-item scores, strengthening A1.

**Standing decision for this sprint:** every new behavioural number is reported at
**≥ 0.5** (plan §3.6), with the 0.25 value alongside wherever a prior number is being
compared. `asym_relabel_asr.py` is the single place the threshold is applied.

## 2026-08-11 — PHASE 1c RESULT (plan §19.1 a–d, §19.2) — job 750363

`scripts/asym_p1c_mech_validity_ext.py` → `outputs/asym_p1c_mechval_20260811_212142_750363`
(43,197 per-prompt projections; 17 suffix conditions × 15 refusal fit layers × 2 concept
layers × 2 positions × (37 held-out + 40 train-pool) prompts; 12 min, forward passes only).
Analysis: `scripts/asym_p1c_analyze.py` → `ANALYSIS_P1C.json`.

### Reproduction check first
Seed 42, held-out, `decision` position, fit layer L18 → `hs[19]`:
no-suffix baseline **3.4023** (handoff: 3.40); refusal-suffix drop **−1.664** vs
random-suffix **−2.045** (handoff Q5: **−1.66 vs −2.04**). **Exact reproduction** — the
instrument agrees with the shipped Q5 artifact before it is extended.

### §19.1(a) — THE Q5 CONCLUSION DOES NOT REPLICATE ACROSS SEEDS
Held-out test (n=37), refusal-optimized suffix vs its own norm-matched random suffix,
paired over prompts (10,000-resample bootstrap + sign-flip permutation):

| seed | mean proj (refusal) | mean proj (random) | diff | boot95 | p | prompts where refusal is lower | reading |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 42 | 1.738 | 1.358 | **+0.381** | [+0.224, +0.545] | 1e-4 | 8/37 (0.22) | refusal suppresses **LESS** — the published Q5 reading |
| 43 | 0.800 | 2.264 | **−1.464** | [−1.748, −1.192] | 1e-4 | **37/37 (1.00)** | refusal suppresses **MORE** |
| 44 | 1.630 | 2.975 | **−1.345** | [−1.638, −1.049] | 1e-4 | 35/37 (0.95) | refusal suppresses **MORE** |

Drops from the no-suffix baseline (3.4023), by arm across the three seeds:

| arm | per-seed drop | mean | sd |
|---|---|---|---|
| refusal-optimized | −1.664 / −2.602 / −1.773 | **−2.013** | 0.513 |
| refusal-random | −2.045 / −1.138 / −0.428 | **−1.204** | **0.810** |
| vanilla doublespeak | −1.125 / −1.255 / −2.299 | −1.560 | 0.644 |
| concept-optimized | −1.067 / −0.849 / −0.694 | −0.870 | 0.188 |
| concept-random | −1.677 / −2.327 / −2.317 | −2.107 | 0.372 |

**Mean over seeds, refusal minus random = −0.810 in favour of the mechanism** (refusal
suppresses its own target *more*), and the sign flips in **2 of 3** seeds relative to the
published claim. The random arm's spread (sd 0.810) is larger than the mechanism arm's
(0.513): seed 42 happened to draw an unusually *effective* random direction.

**Verdict.** The handoff's Q5 statement — *"adversarial suffixes suppress the refusal signal
generically; the mechanism objective adds no specificity even at the internal-target level"* —
is **UNDERPOWERED, not established**: it rests on **one seed with one random draw**, exactly
the single-control weakness plan §3.8 warns about. Restated honestly:

> At the internal-target level the refusal-optimized suffix lowers the held-out refusal
> projection **more** than its matched random counterpart in 2/3 seeds and on average
> (−2.013 vs −1.204), but a single random draw per seed makes this contrast unstable.
> **What does NOT change: this internal-target control does not convert into ASR** (handoff
> 3-seed mean ASR 0.297 refusal vs 0.279 random, no seed significant).

That is a *sharper* dissociation than the one previously reported: the token objective **can**
move its intended internal coordinate, and the behaviour still does not follow. Gate D's
clause (ii) ("does not move its intended internal target more than random") is **WITHDRAWN as
unsupported**; clause (i) (no ASR advantage) **stands**.

### §19.1(c) — NO train→held-out overfitting of the suppression
Drop vs each pool's own no-suffix baseline, train pool (n=40) vs held-out (n=37):

| arm | train | test | transfer ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| refusal s42/43/44 | −1.269 / −2.063 / −1.176 | −1.664 / −2.602 / −1.773 | 1.31 / 1.26 / 1.51 |
| refusal-random | −1.591 / −0.793 / −0.214 | −2.045 / −1.138 / −0.428 | 1.29 / 1.44 / 2.00 |
| vanilla DS | −0.718 / −1.076 / −1.780 | −1.125 / −1.255 / −2.299 | 1.57 / 1.17 / 1.29 |

**Transfer ratio > 1 in all 9 cells.** The universal suffix's refusal suppression is *stronger*
on held-out prompts than on the prompts it was optimized on. So the "universal suffix overfits
its refusal suppression to the train pool" hypothesis (a candidate H3/H5 mechanism) is
**REJECTED** — the suppression generalizes fully.

### §19.2 — LAYER SWEEP: the suppression is generic and NOT localized at the target (H4)
Held-out drop vs no-suffix across refusal fit layers L10–L24, seed 42:

```
  L    refusal    random  vanillaDS   ref-rand
 10     +0.031    +0.048     +0.023     -0.017
 12     +0.014    +0.022     -0.024     -0.008
 14     -0.214    -0.217     -0.199     +0.004
 16     -0.955    -0.868     -0.604     -0.087
 18     -1.664    -2.045     -1.125     +0.381   <- the objective's target layer
 20     -2.170    -2.600     -1.574     +0.429
 22     -2.825    -3.557     -2.093     +0.733
 24     -3.051    -4.055     -2.389     +1.003
```

Three facts: (1) suppression is **nil before ~L14** and grows **monotonically with depth**;
(2) the deepest suppression is at **L24**, the edge of the sweep — **not** at the L18 target
the objective optimized; (3) the layer profile of the refusal suffix and of the random suffix
are **near-identical in shape**, Pearson **r = 0.9965** (refusal vs vanilla doublespeak
r = 0.9968).

**Verdict — strong support for H4 (GENERIC ADVERSARIAL SUPPRESSION).** Any adversarial suffix,
mechanism-derived or not, produces the *same broad late-layer refusal-suppression profile*;
targeting L18 does not carve a dip at L18. The suffixes differ in the **magnitude** of a
shared profile, not in **where** they act.

### D2 — the fit/use position mismatch is material
Refusal-minus-random difference at the two positions (held-out):

| seed | at `decision` (where the axis was fitted/validated) | at `last_suffix` (what the GCG objective read) |
|---|---|---|
| 42 | +0.381 (p=1e-4) | −0.067 (p=0.003) |
| 43 | −1.464 (p=1e-4) | −0.063 (p=0.108) |
| 44 | −1.345 (p=1e-4) | −1.013 (p=1e-4) |

At the position the optimizer actually read, refusal and random are nearly indistinguishable
in 2/3 seeds (|diff| ≈ 0.06, ~20× smaller than at the decision position). The absolute
projections differ in regime too (`last_suffix` ≈ −2.1 vs `decision` ≈ +1.7). Consistent with
defects D1/D2: **the objective barely steered the coordinate it was pointed at**, while the
coordinate that matters behaviourally moved a lot — generically.

**Sanity checks passed:** the `neutral` (single-space) condition has drop exactly 0.0000 vs
no-suffix; template tail measured at 5 tokens, matching the manual token layout in E0.3.
